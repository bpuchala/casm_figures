### Plot 2d clusters

This example treats a CASM project as a 2d hexagonal crystal in the x-y plane. It reads the ``hex_binary_2d/basis_sets/bset.default/clust.json`` file generated by ``ccasm bset -uf``, plots each of the prototype clusters, and writes the figure as ``clusters_2d.pdf``. Clusters are labeled as "\alpha^i", where ``i`` is an orbit index.  Parameters at the top of control how wide the figure is generated, and the size of the generated image, which can control the visual scale.

To run this example:

    python plot_clusters_2d_hex.py
